<h1>Minecraft</h1>
  
<p>Minecraft is a sandbox construction video game developed by Mojang Studios where players interact with a fully modifiable three-dimensional environment made of blocks and entities. Its diverse gameplay lets players choose the way they play, <br> allowing for countless possibilities..</p>

<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p class="red">Gameplay in most game modes of Minecraft consists mainly of adding and destroying a variety of different blocks in a randomly generated world. Except you cannot break blocks in Adventure and Spectator mode.
With these blocks, players can manipulate the world around them, building and destroying structures. As gameplay in Minecraft is so open and unguided, players often set their own goals and play the game as they see fit</p>
<h2>Survival</h2>
<p id="survival">
  <p>In this mode, players have to gather all their materials to build, craft items and tools and gain experience points. There is a health, hunger, and armor bar, an inventory, and also a oxygen bar when underwater. If a player runs out of hearts (health), the player dies and returns to the spawn point. Upon death, the player emits smoke, loses all experience and items, and a death message. Maximum reach is 5 blocks.</p>
</p>
<h2>Creative</h2>
<p id="creative">
  <p>The player has access to an infinite amount of almost all blocks and items available, and can destroy them instantly. Players are invulnerable, unless they fall into the void and do not have health, armor, or hunger, and can fly. The player has access to items not available in Survival mode, e.g. spawn eggs. The player cannot see command blocks if they look through the Creative GUI - they need to spawn command blocks with the /give or /setblock commands. Max reach is 6 blocks.</p>
<h2>Adventure</h2>
<p id="adventure">
  <p>Players can interact with objects such as levers and buttons, and can interact with mobs. However, they can break blocks only with tools having a CanDestroy data tag, and place blocks only if the block they are holding has a CanPlaceOn data tag, making this mode good for adventure maps. Max reach is 5 blocks.</p>
